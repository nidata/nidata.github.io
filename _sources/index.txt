Welcome to Nidata!
==================================

.. container:: index-paragraph

 The goal of this tool is to offer a simple interface for downloading, storing, and getting access to neuroimaging datasets. We want to:

- Decrease the amount of time spent by data scientists in accessing new datasets
- Decrease the difficulty of scientists in sharing their data with the world
- Increase the visibility of available data
